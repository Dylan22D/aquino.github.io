        You were shining in the places where light can’t be seen. It was beautiful, yet so useless. I wanted to pull you out, I wanted to be your guiding hand, I wanted to lead you away from that blackhole which a lot has fallen into. We were best <a href="Love03.html" target="_blank">friends</a> and were so close, yet I could feel you drifting 5 millimeters per second. All I ever wanted was to make you happy, but your smile was brighter with him. You knew what you were getting in to, yet you still chose to stay. Well if it’s your will I will obey, just know I’ll be here every day.
