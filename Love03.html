        It’s funny how a person and four months can do to you. You go from a lifeless, braindead walking corpse to a sunflower that blooms at night. I never really knew my heart existed until she made it beat so much I’d wish I didn’t have one. For the last four to five months, I had the most thrilling and enjoyable time in my life. To the girl that made it all happen, thank you very much! You have no idea how memorable and fun it has been to be with you and I don’t think I could ever forget even a single second. I hope holding on for this long was worth it for you as well because in the end, all I ever wanted was for you to be happy. I may be gone but just know that my last memories were the happiest and the best because they were with you. The last thing I wanted to say was that I’m sorry. I’m sorry I couldn’t be the one to hold your hand, the one to lift you up when you were down, the one who made you feel the happiest. I’m sorry I must leave so soon. Daisuki desu, friend.
