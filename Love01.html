        I was ecstatic at sight of someone so majestic, yet so simple. Words, poems, and even songs filled my head, yet I could only stare. You were there with everyone, they were loud and chaotic, yet you blended with elegance. You looked at me with a smile, and as my heart raced with adrenaline I could only say a faint “Hey”. Your voice was so sweet and soft, so I unknowingly engraved everything you said in my mind. My body was shaking as we said “<a href="Love02.html" target="_blank">goodbye</a>”, but I maintained composure until you hugged me which made my heart skipped a beat or two. I knew you were precious. I knew you were perfect. I knew I needed to make you happy whatever it takes, or at least try.
